1. First of all we need to have a synchronized node with the "sagano" network. Download the mantis client and run:

	./bin/mantis-launcher sagano

It is gonna take some time for the node to synchronize.


2. Then we acquire a blockchain address:

	curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
           "jsonrpc": "2.0",
           "method": "personal_newAccount",
           "params": ["<passphrase>"],
           "id": 1
         }' http://localhost:8546

	For <passphrase> put your own string in. The result is gonna look like:

		{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0xe078b201e498c99aca8e725aad200d51e7a60e4c","id":1}

	The result is your address string beginning with 0x.


3. We need to fund the address using a faucet. Please use the following link:

	https://mantis-testnet-faucet-web.mantis.ws


4. To deploy smart contracts to "sagano" you can follow the instructions on

	https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/quickstart

	Use the section "Alternative: Migrating with Ganache" but do not install Ganache, instead put the following in the "truffle-confifg.js" file:

	module.exports = {
		networks: {
			development: {
				host: "127.0.0.1",
				port: 8546,
				network_id: "*",
				from: "<your acquired address>"
			},
		}
	};


5. When you follow the instructions on "trufflesuite" you may stumble upon an error about locked account. Before running (for example) "truffle migrate", please unlock the account by running:

	curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \                                          
       -d '{
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "method": "personal_unlockAccount",
            "params": ["<your address>", "your passphrase"],
            "id": 1
           }' http://localhost:8546

	This will unlock the account for some time.
